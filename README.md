### Dynamic routing obstacles for OSRM

An application based on [OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM) for drawing roadblocks and traffic zones on a map and dynamically recalculate roads speeds without costly recalculation of the entire routing data.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/HY-OHTUPROJ-OSRM/osrm-project/wiki) for documentation.

## Quick setup

docker compose up -d
```
